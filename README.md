# Experiment with HTMX

This is a proof of concept of creating modal dialogs with forms that you can validate in the backend. It uses `Django`, `django-crispy-forms`, `htmx`, and a few more helper libraries.

To try the project out, follow these steps:

1. Get the source code.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install pip requirements from the `requirements.txt`.
4. Create the local database by running the `migrate` management command.
5. Create a user or superuser.
6. Run development server.
7. Visit `127.0.0.1:8000` and try to log in successfully or not.
